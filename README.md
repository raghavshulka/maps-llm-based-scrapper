# Google Maps Data Scraper - Enhanced Email Finder

A powerful Chrome extension that extracts business contact information from Google Maps search results with advanced email finding capabilities.

## üöÄ Enhanced Features

### Multi-Method Email Extraction
- **Direct Extraction**: Finds emails directly displayed in Google Maps listings
- **Deep DOM Search**: Searches through hidden elements, data attributes, and text nodes
- **Obfuscated Email Detection**: Detects emails written as "contact [at] example [dot] com"
